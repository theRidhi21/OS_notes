## 🌟 **Topic 16: Threads**

### 🧩 What it is:

A **thread** is the **smallest unit of CPU execution** inside a process.
You can think of a process as a factory, and threads are the workers inside that factory — all sharing the same space (memory, files, data).

* A process can have **one thread (single-threaded)** or **multiple threads (multi-threaded)**.
* Each thread performs a specific task **independently but cooperatively**.

### ⚙️ Advantages:

1. **Faster context switching** (less overhead than switching between processes).
2. **Efficient resource sharing** (threads share memory).
3. **Parallel execution** (multiple parts of a program run simultaneously).
4. **Better CPU utilization** (no CPU remains idle).
5. **Responsiveness** (apps don’t freeze while doing heavy work).

### 🧠 Example:

When using a **web browser**:

* One thread loads the page,
* Another handles typing,
* Another downloads images,
  all inside one browser process.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* In **Zeta**, multiple threads handle multiple banking transactions at once.
* In **backend development**, multi-threading improves response time and efficiency.
* In **AI systems**, different threads can handle data loading, model inference, and logging simultaneously.

## 🌟 **Topic 17: Scheduling Criteria**

### 🧩 What it is:

These are the **parameters used to evaluate** how good a CPU scheduling algorithm is.
Think of it like KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for CPU efficiency.

### ⚙️ Main Criteria:

| Criterion           | Meaning                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU Utilization** | Keep CPU busy as much as possible              |
| **Throughput**      | Number of processes completed per unit time    |
| **Turnaround Time** | Total time from submission to completion       |
| **Waiting Time**    | Time spent waiting in ready queue              |
| **Response Time**   | Time from request submission to first response |
| **Fairness**        | Every process gets fair CPU share              |

### 💡 Example:

If a scheduling algorithm gives a low waiting time and high throughput, it’s considered efficient.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* In **server optimization**, these metrics are monitored to ensure quick response.
* **Data centers and cloud systems** aim for maximum CPU utilization and minimal latency.
* Example: When 1,000 customers access an app, good scheduling ensures none feel delay.

## 🌟 **Topic 18: Scheduling Algorithms**

### 🧩 What it is:

Scheduling algorithms decide **which process gets CPU next** based on certain rules.

### ⚙️ Major Algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**

   * Processes executed in order of arrival.
   * Simple but can cause *waiting time* for short processes.
   * 🧠 Example: Like a queue at a billing counter.

2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**

   * Process with least execution time runs first.
   * Minimizes waiting time but needs job length prediction.
   * 🧠 Example: Like serving quick customers first.

3. **Priority Scheduling**

   * Each process has a priority; higher one gets CPU first.
   * May cause *starvation* for low-priority tasks.

4. **Round Robin (RR)**

   * Each process gets equal time slice (quantum) in rotation.
   * Best for time-sharing systems (like multitasking OS).
   * 🧠 Example: Like each student getting equal time to answer.

5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

   * Processes divided into multiple queues (system, interactive, batch).
   * Each queue has its own scheduling policy.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* In **OS kernels (Linux, Windows)**, a mix of algorithms (like RR + Priority) is used.
* In **cloud platforms**, task scheduling algorithms determine server allocation.
* Example: In **Zeta**, scheduling ensures background processes (data sync, transactions) don’t block real-time user actions.

## 🌟 **Topic 19: Multiple Processor Scheduling**

### 🧩 What it is:

In systems with **more than one CPU (multi-core or multiprocessor)**, scheduling must decide **which process runs on which CPU**.

### ⚙️ Types:

1. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP):**

   * One master processor controls scheduling and other processors.
   * Easier to implement but less efficient.

2. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):**

   * All processors are equal; each runs its own scheduler.
   * More efficient and commonly used today.

### ⚙️ Key Issues:

* **Load Balancing:** Keep all CPUs equally busy.
* **Processor Affinity:** Keep a process on the same CPU for cache efficiency.
* **Scalability:** System should perform well even as CPUs increase.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* Used in **multi-core servers** where load must be distributed evenly.
* Example: **Zeta’s payment server** may distribute user transactions across 8 CPU cores using SMP scheduling.
* In **machine learning training**, different cores handle different model computations.

## 🌟 **Topic 20: System Calls (fork, exit, wait, exec)**

These are **important process-related system calls** that control process lifecycle.

### ⚙️ Key Calls:

1. **`fork()`** – Creates a new process (child).

   * Child process is a copy of parent.
   * Example: `pid = fork();`

2. **`exec()`** – Replaces current process with a new program.

   * Used after fork to run a different program.

3. **`exit()`** – Ends the process and releases resources.

   * Example: `exit(0);`

4. **`wait()`** – Makes parent process wait until child finishes.

   * Prevents creation of zombie processes.

### 🧠 Example Flow:

```c
pid = fork();        // Create child
if(pid == 0)
   exec("newprog");  // Child executes new program
else
   wait();           // Parent waits till child completes
exit(0);
```

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* These are used in **process management systems**, **web servers**, and **compilers**.
* Example: When a web server forks a new process for every client, it later uses `wait()` to collect its result.
* In **container orchestration (like Docker)**, process control follows the same principles.
