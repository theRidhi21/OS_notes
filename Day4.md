## 🌟 **Topic 16: Threads**

### 🧩 What it is:

A **thread** is a **lightweight process** — a smaller unit inside a process that can run independently.

Each process can have **multiple threads** sharing:

* Code
* Data
* Files
  But each has its own **register** and **stack**.

Example:
A browser — one thread loads a page, another downloads a file, another handles user input.

### ⚙️ Types:

1. **User-level threads** – managed by user programs.
2. **Kernel-level threads** – managed by the operating system.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* Used in **backend systems** for multitasking — e.g., Zeta or Google Pay apps handling multiple user requests.
* In **machine learning**, threads help in parallel data loading.
* In **banking apps**, one thread handles transactions while another updates balances — both within the same process.

## 🌟 **Topic 17: Scheduling Criteria**

### 🧩 What it is:

When the OS decides *which process or thread* to run next, it uses certain **criteria** to evaluate the best choice.

### ⚙️ Main Criteria:

| Criterion       | Description                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| CPU Utilization | Keep CPU as busy as possible                 |
| Throughput      | Number of processes completed per time unit  |
| Turnaround Time | Time to execute a process fully              |
| Waiting Time    | Time a process spends waiting in ready queue |
| Response Time   | Time to start responding after a request     |

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* In **servers**, minimizing response time means faster user experience.
* Example: In Zeta payments, optimizing CPU utilization ensures instant transactions even under heavy load.

## 🌟 **Topic 18: Scheduling Algorithms**

### 🧩 What it is:

OS uses **algorithms** to decide which process runs next.

### ⚙️ Common Algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** – simple, non-preemptive.
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)** – runs the shortest job next.
3. **RR (Round Robin)** – each process gets equal CPU time.
4. **Priority Scheduling** – higher priority runs first.
5. **Multilevel Queue** – processes divided into queues (system, user, etc.).

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* In cloud servers, scheduling algorithms balance workload efficiently.
* Example: In **Zeta**, multiple transactions come simultaneously — the system schedules based on priority (instant transfers first).
* In **datacenters**, scheduling determines how tasks are distributed to CPUs for performance.

## 🌟 **Topic 19: Multiple-Processor Scheduling**

### 🧩 What it is:

When a system has **multiple CPUs**, scheduling becomes more complex — the OS must decide:

* Which process goes to which processor,
* And how to balance the load.

### ⚙️ Types:

1. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP):** One CPU controls others.
2. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** All CPUs are equal — any can schedule tasks.

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* Used in **multi-core processors** and **cloud servers**.
* Example: In **Zeta**, backend systems use SMP — multiple processors handle transactions in parallel to increase speed.
* Also used in **AI/ML training** — distributing data across GPUs for faster learning.

## 🌟 **Topic 20: System Call Interface (fork, exec, wait, exit)**

### 🧩 What it is:

These are **core process management system calls** in Unix/Linux.

| System Call | Description                              |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `fork()`    | Creates a new child process              |
| `exec()`    | Replaces process with a new program      |
| `wait()`    | Makes a parent wait until child finishes |
| `exit()`    | Terminates the process                   |

### ⚙️ Example:

```c
pid = fork();       // Create child process
if (pid == 0)
    exec("program"); // Child executes another program
else
    wait();          // Parent waits for child
```

### 💼 Corporate World Use:

* These calls are the **foundation of multitasking**.
* Every time you open multiple tabs or run apps together, these system calls are used.
* In **backend process handling** or **containerization (like Docker)**, these concepts are essential.
